# Persona Forge â€“ Chatbot with Preset Personas

**PersonaForge** is an AI-powered chatbot designed to make conversations smarter, more personal, and more fun.  
Instead of a one-size-fits-all assistant, PersonaForge gives you **ready-to-use personas** (like *Teacher, Copywriter, Mentor, or Comedian*) and the freedom to **craft your own unique personas**.

With just a switch, the AI can transform from a friendly teacher into a witty stand-up comedianâ€”or from a business consultant into a motivational coach. ðŸš€
