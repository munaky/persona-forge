# Persona Forge â€“ Chatbot with Preset Personas

**PersonaForge** is an AI-powered chatbot designed to make conversations smarter, more personal, and more fun.
Instead of a one-size-fits-all assistant, PersonaForge gives you **ready-to-use personas** (like *Teacher, Copywriter, Mentor, or Comedian*) and the freedom to **craft your own unique personas**.

With just a switch, the AI can transform from a friendly teacher into a witty stand-up comedianâ€”or from a business consultant into a motivational coach. ðŸš€

## âœ¨ Features

* **Preset Personas** â†’ Jump right in with a collection of built-in personas for different use cases.
* **Custom Persona Builder** â†’ Define your own persona with a *name, description, and tone of voice*.
* **Dynamic Chat Interface** â†’ Conversations instantly adapt to the selected personaâ€™s style.
* **Persona Management** â†’ Edit, delete, or save your favorite personas for quick access.
* **Flexible Mode** â†’ Bypass presets and send prompts directly when you just need a plain AI assistant.

âš¡ Whether you want productivity, creativity, or just a bit of funâ€”PersonaForge adapts to you.

Do you want me to also add some **badges (e.g. built with, license, stars)** and a **screenshot/demo section** so it looks even more like a polished open-source project README?
